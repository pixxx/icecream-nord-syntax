# icecream-nord-syntax

#### ...a modified ___Nord Atom Syntax___

Colorful dark syntax theme, using the amazing _nord-atom-syntax_ as basis, colors are inspired by childhood memories.

Lesscss Example:

Nord supports many languages, there might be colors not working so well right now, because of that. I still have to go through them all... And I might add or remove a few languages! But rather "add" because it's a nice to have support for all those langauges I think.
