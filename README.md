#### ...a modified [___Nord Atom Syntax___](https://atom.io/themes/nord-atom-syntax)

Very colorful dark syntax theme, using the amazing [_nord-atom-syntax_](https://atom.io/themes/nord-atom-syntax) as basis, why is this not forked then, :rage: :bird: I literally copied the code on top of a scaffolding, created with atom syntax theme generator :scream:

Guess I had too much of these :shaved_ice: :custard: :cake: :fish_cake: and :coffee:

Nord supports many languages, there might be colors not working so well right now, because of that. I still have to go through them all... And I might add or remove a few languages! But rather "add" because it's a nice to have support for all those langauges I think.
